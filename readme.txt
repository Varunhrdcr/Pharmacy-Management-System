<h2>Pharmacy Management System</h2>
Our Aim is to design and create a PHARMACY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. This enables the pharmacist to quickly look for medicines available and have detailed information on all product details to make it more efficient.

This Pharmacy management System has a very user-friendly interface. Thus, the admin will feel very easy to work on it. By using this system admin can manage customer request, medicinal details and stock. The data can be quickly altered by the pharmacist and make it easier for him to manage multiple customers in a short span of time.

Java was used to create the front end for the system and MYSQL was used for the back end. The front end and back-end are connected using the JDBC Server.
